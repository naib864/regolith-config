# regolith-config
Collection of files to get my regolith setup up and running.

i3 config in .config/regolith/i3  
polybar launch script in .config/polybar/midnight/launch.sh

# Polybar files
The polybar config mostly comes from [this](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) repository and is based on the grayblocks style there. I modified the colors and some stylings.
